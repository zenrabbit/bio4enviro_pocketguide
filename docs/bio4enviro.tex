Welcome to biology for environmental management. The goal of this course is to examine global grand challenges that we face through the lens of solutions from science. Science can be magical because it provides us with incredible outcomes in so many domains of the human endeavour. Here, we work to find the magic spells from science for the environment to promote the well-being of people and the planet.

There is an opportunity for us to mobilize science to do social good. We we can leverage what we know, what we do not know, i.e.~uncertainty, and what we need to know, to enable conservation, protection, and better management of the environment. This benefits the environment. It benefits us. Here are the \href{https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2020-0021}{ten simple rules} the underpin an evidence-informed philosophy for the entire course \citep{RN6861}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Rationale}

For each environmental management challenge case examined, students will be responsible for reading the literature provided at their own pace. The professor will facilitate learning as needed.

The goal is to become more literate environmental citizens and develop, consolidate, and evaluate critical environmental science thinking and problem solving.

The first module highlights some of the most pressing challenges and more common replicable tools used by the scientific community. The summative test is provided immediately at the start of course to enable asynchronous work and provide a clear, transparent, and testable outcome for this module.

The second module provides an opportunity for students in this upper-year offering to do a deep dive into a topic that care about deeply. The dimension of the challenge and the solution they pick is open provided it is well articulated. The graphical assignment is a stepping stone or scaffolding to the final paper. It is also a chance to be as creative as students elect to be with communicating science to the public. The final paper is an Ignite, Forum, or Mini-review format contribution on their topic appropriate for a general science journal. These types of papers are increasingly common and important in science and used extensively for evidence-informed decision making by leaders.

Read and and use the papers to link environmental challenges that we collectively face with potential solutions. Only one solution per challenge is suggested here, but there are many dimensions to each challenge and numerous solutions too.

The link to decks are optional. They are my interpretation of the papers from a science-to-magic philosophy and identify the salient elements and concepts from each reading that resonated with my perspective as an ecologist.

We experience weather but live with climate. Climate is complex. Climate change has both effects on us and is a response to many drivers including anthropenic processes. The reading provided examines urban effects specifically \citep{RN5995}. Use the ten simple rules suggested to structure your analysis of this paper \citep{RN6861}. There is at least one solution that can enable better science. Replication and being able to test the same ideas again can be done using an open-source, and free, programming language to work with data, draw plots, and do statistics. \href{https://www.r-project.org}{R} is one such tool, and it can be used to promote solutions for others to try with their challenges because the code can be shared (i.e.~fondly recall math classes, show your work), and this documentation of science using data improves our solutions \citep{RN4523}.

We need to eat. Pollinators provide many fundamental ecological services including interactions with plants that we use for crops and sustenance. Most flowering plants are not wind pollinated. This reading explores co-occurrence patterns between plants and pollinators to document long-term declines \citep{RN6388}. Not great news. However, there are solutions - many. One of the most exciting to me is citizen science. Citizen science is a powerful tool for conservationists \citep{RN5997}. It is also profound because we are all citizens, together, and scientific thinking comes naturally to humans. We love to count, observe natural systems, and have strong inherent tendencies to connect with nature. This is a solution for many global grand challenges associated with the environment.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Context}

Invasive species are a global issue. Introduced species that become invasive can dramatically and irrevocably modify ecosystems. The paper provided here is an exceptional example of leveraging fundamental science, i.e.~biogeography, with the contemporary study of this issue \citep{RN5996}. To study a species from one place in another, particularly between continents, teams in science can do the work more efficiently and more effectively. Team science is thus a logical solution to this issue \citep{RN6000}. As you know from your science work, collaboration is not always easy though particularly when the work is being evaluated - whether in a class for groupwork or by a university of its researchers or by funding agencies in contrasting the merit of a researcher. Working with others to tackle global grand challenges is critical, but we also need to adapt how we value work in teams in science.

Land is a commodity. We compete with plants and other animals for space. Land literally provides the space for most components of human society through provision of direct and indirect ecosystem services. In the challenge reading, a synthesis of the restoration research for drylands in California was summarized \citep{RN5980}. The technique or replicable solution used was a formal systematic review, but there are many such synthesis tools \citep{RN3216}. Synthesis tools provide the big picture to frame questions and evaluate the relevant merit or at least frequency that scientists use one technique versus another.

Traditional formative assessments such as in-class tests or exams are well understood. The rules of the game and extent of practice and experience with them vary from person-to-person, but most schools still adopt fixed-duration testing with limited to no access to outside materials. Open-book tests are common as well and typically include some access to resources such as notes or course materials but can also include open and online resources. The take-home test is a powerful and positive summative assessment instrument. However, effective study and prep can not always be clearly described for the learner. Strengths can include full and open access to materials online, experts, collaborative input, and adequate time to do deep work and think with reflection on insightful answers. Nonetheless, a limitation can be divergent expectations between student or learner and the graders. A take-home test is a bit of a chimera because it includes components of routine work, thinking, and depth associated with essays and papers but is nonetheless at times designed more as test with specific questions, Hence, a short primer on some ideas to consider from a workflow perspective are provided herein.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Read the test in advance and give yourself time to ruminate, reflect, and ideate.\\
\item
  Review test questions and ensure that you read all questions to the end before starting work.\\
\item
  If there are readings, compile and collate them in advance so you have everything you need in one place.\\
\item
  Review the rubric.\\
\item
  Reverse-engineer this rubric to populate a list of terms, ideas, or visual-text hooks (keywords or concepts) that a grader will likely seek in refereeing your work.
\item
  Open book = open information. Take advantage of related ideas, papers, reviews, and commit the appropriate and most parsimonious amount of time to secure supporting resources.\\
\item
  Set a time limit for specific tasks and block your time into meaningful chunks with clear intermediate-level goals. For instance, get papers in one block, review rubric in another, etc.\\
\item
  Write, take a break, and check rubric. Check your writing for clarity. If there are synthesis, design, or principle responses, step back, and consider high-level critical thinking elements or rules associated with \href{https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010139}{good research planning}.\\
\item
  Consider triage answers that do not match your cognitive style, expertise, or are dissatisfied with the response. Use point value and relative weighting to decide if there better ways to allocate your time or select between questions to submit if provided.\\
\item
  Simple, but review the instructions on formatting, submission, and guidelines for the format of the work. Submit.

Time to choose your own adventure. Flex your creativity. Apply your critical thinking skills to an environmental challenge that is important - to \textbf{you}! Find your science-to-magic workflow and do a scientific synthesis. The \href{https://sdgs.un.org/goals}{United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e.~SDGs)} are a perfect place to begin. There are a total of 17 goals describing 169 targets as of 2021. Virtually every single goal is directly or indirectly tied to the environment. Some, are very direct such as clean water, life on land, life below water, climate action, zero hunger, and poverty. We need natural systems to sustain and support these goals. Natural systems now need us, and now you here, to summarize the scientific evidence for some focused element of a goal. This is a just a suggested focus - any environmental management challenge is fair game for synthesis and certainly will benefit from the process.

\hypertarget{synthesis-1}{%
\subsubsection*{Synthesis}\label{synthesis-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Synthesis}

Scientific synthesis is big picture science that describe a set of studies on a pinpointed topic \citep{RN3216}. There are at least three simple and direct options that are amenable to a capture of the research associated with the environmental challenge you identified.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Narrative review as a highlight, short commentary, or new idea paper that is a snapshot of the key findings from a field research summarizing the main discoveries and/or listing the most critical research gaps. Papers like these are often called \textbf{Insights}, \textbf{Forum}, or \textbf{Ignite}.
\item
  Systematic reviews are similar to narrative reviews, but clear criteria are listed explaining how you selected papers (i.e.~these search terms used in the Web of Science, only studies that had these key inclusion attributes, etc.). Systematic are more replicable because others could follow your steps and get the same set of papers and hopefully reach similar conclusions about the corpus of evidence. These reviews also typically provide some simple quantitative data about the set of studies such as number of countries where the research was done, total sample sizes, number of variables examined, or any attributes that describe what the research was for a specific detail. The narrative component is similar to the first option because it can state what we know and what do not but these reviews do so \emph{much} more precisely. Even a few numbers go a long way to convincing people about the extent that we know or have studied a subject in science. Papers like these are often termed \textbf{Short Commentary} or \textbf{Mini-Review}.
\item
  Meta-analyses are systematic reviews plus for each primary study you summarize, you capture the relative efficacy of the treatment tested. Papers like this are often termed \textbf{Reviews} or \textbf{Meta-analyses} but other terms can be used too. Note: in some fields of research the terms `systematic review' and `meta-analysis' are used interchangeably, but in most environmental sciences, meta-analyses always have a measure of the strength of evidence from each studied included in the synthesis whilst systematic reviews typically do not.
\end{enumerate}

So for instance, narrative review might provide insights into vaccine research and reported that we have tested three vaccine types but need to test more alternatives. A systematic review would state this too but mention how they checked the science, i.e.~we checked 100 papers using these terms x,y, \& z in Web of Science, and it might also state how many people were tested in total in all studies. This is thus a more powerful synthesis. However, the gold standard would be the meta-analysis that can summarize all of the above but also reports how well each vaccine type tested actually works on average across all the studies for each one.

Scientific communication is now its own field of research and activity. It is critical that biology for environmental management promotes better communication. Without effective delivery of evidence, decisions that need science will struggle. Here, we use ten simple rules for \href{https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005845}{scientific comics} \citep{RN7247} to inform our sharing the scientific synthesis work began in the previous chapter. Simplication of science and aggregation of complex evidence is not a trivial skill. It is a challenge to respectfully communicate science but ensure it is accessible to a wide audience. Comics are perfect. Infographics are also powerful, and they are typically more complex information but compile findings still very visually. A comic tells a story and shares the science whilst infographics are also visual but connect ideas in a mini-poster format to the share evidence. \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08542-5}{Here are examples} of the very best from the journal Nature.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Context}

As described in the `scientific synthesis' section in this course, there are at least three contemporary tools available to a synthesis scientist in the environmental sciences. Narrative reviews are most effective when they briefly highlight key findings for a small field of research or identify critical gaps. Systematic reviews are more significant contribution to knowledge engineering because they provide the blueprint for replication, i.e.~they describe how they selected the studies they summarized, and also because they provide more specific evidence. Finally, meta-analyses are the gold standard. For the purposes of this course of study, biology for environmental management, any of these three options are within reach. Nonetheless, metas can be demanding in time, and if you elect to tackle your environmental challenge with this tool, I recommend a very limited and restrictive set of studies. This can be done using very precise terms in The Web of Science or Google Scholar and/or limiting returns of papers to only the top 10-15 most cited or more recent 2-5 years. The capacity to critically examine a published meta is an invaluable asset to becoming a more literate citizen. The paper \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1150}{`How to critically read ecological meta-analyses'}\citep{RN3498} is a resource developed for that purpose. Here is \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1109}{another `how-to-read'} published metas, and finally, if this is the synthesis tool for you, \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11301-021-00247-4}{here is recent practical guide how to do meta-analysis} (in eight steps).

Writing is an art. Telling a story well, even in science, is a fundamental professional life skill. Being brief is a virtue. Integrating evidence into scientific writing without being overwhelming is ideal. Here, you can tackle this by reusing your environmental evidence for the challenge you selected. This is an excellent, brief set of guidelines to consider, in general, to consider for better, more clearly structured writing \citep{RN7239}. Yes, there is always room for improvement.

Specific this course, you must choose narrative, systematic, or meta. This might have been decided right-up-front because of the nature of the challenge and the evidence that was reported in the papers you compiled. For instance, there was limited data you could extract from the papers, each paper tackled the same challenge but did so very differently, or it was not tractable to process the evidence more formally either then identifying what we know, do not, or where to go.

Science is creative. Reading scientific literature can also be a creative process. \href{https://help.open.ac.uk/active-reading}{Active reading} includes highlights, annotation, and note taking. These approaches to reading and study can increase retention, comprehension, and engagement with scientific ideas. However, the teaching philosophy and pedagogy of CREATE is novel and relevant and takes this one step further. \href{https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/176/3/1381/6062159}{\textbf{CREATE pedagogy}} stands for \textbf{C}onsider, \textbf{R}ead, \textbf{E}lucidate the hypothesis or purpose, \textbf{A}nalyze and interpret data or evidence, and \textbf{T}hink of the next \textbf{E}xperiment. This reading process is creative, active, and phenomenal practice for all professional work.

If the process seems useful to you, please give it a try for this course. This work is \textbf{optional}, but it is literally only 5-10 minutes extra per week. Here are some proposed exercises for you to consider to test out the CREATE approach. If there is time in lectures, we will do them together. Use paper, Powerpoint, or any sketching digital tool you prefer to write or draw. If you elect to try them out and want to submit them as well, \textbf{optional}, there are spots provided in \href{https://turnitin.com}{turnitin.com}.

Make it count! Help those around you use scientific evidence to inform their decisions. Science can support better decisions in health, the environment, social policy, and all domains of the human endeavour. We need to make better decisions, and we can do it. Use your creative spirit and now finely-honed critical thinking. Be on the lookout for solutions. Frame problems in life, big or small, as challenges. Seek solutions in the obvious and in the novel. Less is more. Often the simplest fix is the best. Good luck, and I hope you enjoyed these materials and this course as much I did.
