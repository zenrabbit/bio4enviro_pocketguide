The goal of this course is to examine global grand challenges that we face through the lens of solutions from science. Science can be magical because it provides us with incredible outcomes in so many domains of the human endeavour. Here, we work to find the magic spells from science for the environment to promote the well-being of people and the planet. If you are electing to engage with this learning opportunity formally for BIOL4265 at York University, here is the official course outline. There is an opportunity for us to mobilize science to do social good. We we can leverage what we know, what we do not know, i.e. uncertainty, and what we need to know, to enable conservation, protection, and better management of the environment. This benefits the environment. It benefits us. Here are the ten simple rules the underpin an evidence-informed philosophy for the entire course (Christopher J. Lortie and Owen 2020). Learning outcomes Critically read environmental science peer-reviewed journal publications. Reverse-engineer the critical reproducible science tools using peer-reviewed publications. Appreciate the extent and scope of environmental challenges we face globally. Explain the balance between direct human needs and environmental health. Do a formal synthesis such as meta-analysis or systematic review. Effectively communicate scientific synthesis findings to the public. Structure Module 1. Read a total of 9 useful peer-reviewed science publications. Test your practical knowledge by applying to a new challenge. Module 2. Choose your own adventure (i.e. a dimension of an environmental challenge you care about). Draw a comic or infographic to communicate challenge to the public. Write a short synthesis paper on this topic for a scientific audience. Rationale For each environmental management challenge case examined, students will be responsible for reading the literature provided at their own pace. The professor will facilitate learning as needed. The goal is to become more literate environmental citizens and develop, consolidate, and evaluate critical environmental science thinking and problem solving. The first module highlights some of the most pressing challenges and more common replicable tools used by the scientific community. The summative test is provided immediately at the start of course to enable asynchronous work and provide a clear, transparent, and testable outcome for this module. The second module provides an opportunity for students in this upper-year offering to do a deep dive into a topic that care about deeply. The dimension of the challenge and the solution they pick is open provided it is well articulated. The graphical assignment is a stepping stone or scaffolding to the final paper. It is also a chance to be as creative as students elect to be with communicating science to the public. The final paper is an Ignite, Forum, or Mini-review format contribution on their topic appropriate for a general science journal. These types of papers are increasingly common and important in science and used extensively for evidence-informed decision making by leaders.

Link science for cities to your life. Explore one tool that can enable replicable solutions. Context We experience weather but live with climate. Climate is complex. Climate change has both effects on us and is a response to many drivers including anthropenic processes. The reading provided examines urban effects specifically (McCarthy, Best, and Betts 2010). Use the ten simple rules suggested to structure your analysis of this paper (Christopher J. Lortie and Owen 2020). There is at least one solution that can enable better science. Replication and being able to test the same ideas again can be done using an open-source, and free, programming language to work with data, draw plots, and do statistics. R is one such tool, and it can be used to promote solutions for others to try with their challenges because the code can be shared (i.e. fondly recall math classes, show your work), and this documentation of science using data improves our solutions (C. J. Lortie 2017). Reflection questions What are some of the other dimensions of climate change? What tools or other solutions do scientists in many fields use to address a changing climate? What is the biggest challenge of this issue that must be addressed and would R help? Formative checklist or steps Read the paper. Consider the questions provided, to guide your thinking and practice implementing evidence to do magic (i.e. potentially use science to address challenges). These are not graded, and the purpose is to reflect and actively engage with readings. Review the slide decks (optional) after you read and consider the two papers to see if similar concepts resonated with you. "],["pollinators.html", "Chapter 4 Pollinator declines", " Chapter 4 Pollinator declines Learning outcomes Appreciate the relative importance of pollinators globally. Identify the links between pollinators, plants, and functional ecology. Explore one tool that can enable replicable solutions. Context We need to eat. Pollinators provide many fundamental ecological services including interactions with plants that we use for crops and sustenance. Most flowering plants are not wind pollinated. This reading explores co-occurrence patterns between plants and pollinators to document long-term declines (Burkle, Marlin, and Knight 2013). Not great news. However, there are solutions - many. One of the most exciting to me is citizen science. Citizen science is a powerful tool for conservationists (McKinley et al. 2017). It is also profound because we are all citizens, together, and scientific thinking comes naturally to humans. We love to count, observe natural systems, and have strong inherent tendencies to connect with nature. This is a solution for many global grand challenges associated with the environment. Reflection questions Does the species/taxa of pollinators matter? Citizen science can measure processes, but can it also be used to help conserve or protect or restore too? How can citizen science at universities be better enabled? How do we link what we learn with what we do? Formative checklist or steps Read the paper. Consider the questions provided, to guide your thinking and practice implementing evidence to do magic (i.e. potentially use science to address challenges).

"],["invasions.html", "Chapter 5 Invasive species", " Chapter 5 Invasive species Learning outcomes Be able to define invasive species. Describe some of the ways that ecologists test invasive species. Examine whether a grand challenge needs a small or large (even global) team. Context Invasive species are a global issue. Introduced species that become invasive can dramatically and irrevocably modify ecosystems. The paper provided here is an exceptional example of leveraging fundamental science, i.e. biogeography, with the contemporary study of this issue (Nielsen et al. 2017). To study a species from one place in another, particularly between continents, teams in science can do the work more efficiently and more effectively. Team science is thus a logical solution to this issue (Goring et al. 2014). As you know from your science work, collaboration is not always easy though particularly when the work is being evaluated - whether in a class for groupwork or by a university of its researchers or by funding agencies in contrasting the merit of a researcher. Working with others to tackle global grand challenges is critical, but we also need to adapt how we value work in teams in science. Reflection questions What is biogeography? Are invasive species always ‘bad’ or problematic? How we up-value scientists that are more inclusive and collaborative? Formative checklist or steps Read the paper.

"],["landuse.html", "Chapter 6 Landuse challenges", " Chapter 6 Landuse challenges Learning outcomes Be able to describe and differentiate restoration from other challenge &amp; solution categories. Explore one set of ideas that link land use to people. Understand some of the variety of synthesis tools available to contemporary scientists. Context Land is a commodity. We compete with plants and other animals for space. Land literally provides the space for most components of human society through provision of direct and indirect ecosystem services. In the challenge reading, a synthesis of the restoration research for drylands in California was summarized (Christopher J. Lortie et al. 2018). The technique or replicable solution used was a formal systematic review, but there are many such synthesis tools (C. J. Lortie 2014). Synthesis tools provide the big picture to frame questions and evaluate the relevant merit or at least frequency that scientists use one technique versus another. Reflection questions Is better late than never possible for many other ecosystems in addition to drylands? Why was the direct human dimension of restoration in drylands not examined in this case study challenge? What synthesis technique described in the solution paper best matched your thinking style?

"],["testprep.html", "Chapter 7 Test prep", " Chapter 7 Test prep Learning outcomes Be able to select your own solution to an environmental challenge. Appreciate that there are many dimensions to every challenge. Write a clear, short description linking a replicable tool to a challenge studied in the scientific literature. Context Lakes and other bodies of water are our natural canary-in-the-coalmine tools to examine many components of global change. Here, the test paper is provided in advance (Vogt, Sharma, and Leavitt 2017). Use the ‘ten simple rules to facilitate evidence implementation…’ (Christopher J. Lortie and Owen 2020) and ‘ten simple rules for more objective decision-making’ (Fletcher, Wagner, and Bourne 2020) to structure notes and test prep. Steps for test prep Read the challenge paper. Make a list of all the solutions that they used. Select one solution, find a paper about that solution, see test question. Re-read the ten simple rules that underpins this course and read the ten simple rules for making better decisions too. Go to next chapter in this resource for the test. "],["test.html", "Chapter 8 Test", " Chapter 8 Test Instructions Read this paper (Vogt, Sharma, and Leavitt 2017). Answer the following questions. Use no more than on page per answer with at least an 11point font, 1inch margins, and single-spacing. Test questions Describe the environmental management challenge case associated with this topic and publication. In the summary, please ensure that you cover the following: link the basic science to the management (i.e. explain what the authors tested &amp; measured and then how this can relate to management), highlight the extent (i.e. explain if it is a global, regional, or local issue and why), and propose the implication of ignoring this issue. total = 10 points. Describe why this is not an environmental management challenge – i.e. play the ‘devil’s advocate’ because we know this happens all the time or more fairly every environmental issue is a balance between direct and indirect benefits from a natural system. Do not use fallacious arguments or ad hominem to do this. Use the following lines of argument: list 2 critical limitations of the study (or what viable improvements are needed), highlight the direct needs of people for the system/idea/issue and explain, explain a ‘hope for the best’ strategy that maximizes direct benefit to humans and propose an argument for the resilience/recovery/buffering of the system without a big change (i.e. business as usual model). total = 10 points. Reverse engineer a general, replicable solution to this challenge. list solutions beginning with the most evident in descending relevance order (exactly like you did every practice day), propose and explain the rers that is most relevant based on research, cite the research you did to design your rers by providing the citation to two solution papers and include just a single sentence for each explaining why you selected that paper as evidence. total = 20 points. Format for answers Write in full sentences, no more than 1 page per answer. Total of 3 pages :). Include your name, surname, and student ID at the top of each page.
