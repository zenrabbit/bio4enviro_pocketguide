The goal of this course is to examine global grand challenges that we face through the lens of solutions from science. Science can be magical because it provides us with incredible outcomes in so many domains of the human endeavour. Here, we work to find the magic spells from science for the environment to promote the well-being of people and the planet. There is an opportunity for us to mobilize science to do social good. We we can leverage what we know, what we do not know, i.e. uncertainty, and what we need to know, to enable conservation, protection, and better management of the environment. This benefits the environment. It benefits us. Here are the ten simple rules the underpin an evidence-informed philosophy for the entire course (Christopher J. Lortie and Owen 2020). Course outline If you are electing to engage with this learning opportunity formally, please see the official course outline for specific details. There are three summative assessments. 1. Test (apply the challenge-solution framework). 2. Make a scientific comic or infographic for a new challenge of your choice. 3. Write a super short ignite synthesis paper. Learning outcomes Critically read environmental science peer-reviewed journal publications. Reverse-engineer the critical reproducible science tools using peer-reviewed publications. Appreciate the extent and scope of environmental challenges we face globally. Explain the balance between direct human needs and environmental health. Do a formal synthesis such as meta-analysis or systematic review. Effectively communicate scientific synthesis findings to the public. Steps Module 1. Read a total of 9 useful peer-reviewed science publications. Test your practical knowledge by applying to a new challenge. Module 2. Choose your own adventure (i.e. a dimension of an environmental challenge you care about). Draw a comic or infographic to communicate challenge to the public. Write a short synthesis paper on this topic for a scientific audience. Rationale For each environmental management challenge case examined, students will be responsible for reading the literature provided at their own pace. The professor will facilitate learning as needed. The goal is to become more literate environmental citizens and develop, consolidate, and evaluate critical environmental science thinking and problem solving. The first module highlights some of the most pressing challenges and more common replicable tools used by the scientific community. The summative test is provided immediately at the start of course to enable asynchronous work and provide a clear, transparent, and testable outcome for this module. The second module provides an opportunity for students in this upper-year offering to do a deep dive into a topic that care about deeply. The dimension of the challenge and the solution they pick is open provided it is well articulated. The graphical assignment is a stepping stone or scaffolding to the final paper. It is also a chance to be as creative as students elect to be with communicating science to the public. The final paper is an Ignite, Forum, or Mini-review format contribution on their topic appropriate for a general science journal. These types of papers are increasingly common and important in science and used extensively for evidence-informed decision making by leaders.

Link science for cities to your life. Explore one tool that can enable replicable solutions. Context We experience weather but live with climate. Climate is complex. Climate change has both effects on us and is a response to many drivers including anthropenic processes. The reading provided examines urban effects specifically (McCarthy, Best, and Betts 2010). Use the ten simple rules suggested to structure your analysis of this paper (Christopher J. Lortie and Owen 2020). There is at least one solution that can enable better science. Replication and being able to test the same ideas again can be done using an open-source, and free, programming language to work with data, draw plots, and do statistics. R is one such tool, and it can be used to promote solutions for others to try with their challenges because the code can be shared (i.e. fondly recall math classes, show your work), and this documentation of science using data improves our solutions (C. J. Lortie 2017). Reflection questions What are some of the other dimensions of climate change? What tools or other solutions do scientists in many fields use to address a changing climate?

"],["pollinators.html", "Chapter 3 Pollinator declines", " Chapter 3 Pollinator declines Learning outcomes Appreciate the relative importance of pollinators globally. Identify the links between pollinators, plants, and functional ecology. Explore one tool that can enable replicable solutions. Context We need to eat. Pollinators provide many fundamental ecological services including interactions with plants that we use for crops and sustenance. Most flowering plants are not wind pollinated. This reading explores co-occurrence patterns between plants and pollinators to document long-term declines (Burkle, Marlin, and Knight 2013). Not great news. However, there are solutions - many. One of the most exciting to me is citizen science. Citizen science is a powerful tool for conservationists (McKinley et al. 2017). It is also profound because we are all citizens, together, and scientific thinking comes naturally to humans. We love to count, observe natural systems, and have strong inherent tendencies to connect with nature. This is a solution for many global grand challenges associated with the environment. Reflection questions Does the species/taxa of pollinators matter? Citizen science can measure processes, but can it also be used to help conserve or protect or restore too?

"],["invasions.html", "Chapter 4 Invasive species", " Chapter 4 Invasive species Learning outcomes Be able to define invasive species. Describe some of the ways that ecologists test invasive species. Examine whether a grand challenge needs a small or large (even global) team. Context Invasive species are a global issue. Introduced species that become invasive can dramatically and irrevocably modify ecosystems. The paper provided here is an exceptional example of leveraging fundamental science, i.e. biogeography, with the contemporary study of this issue (Nielsen et al. 2017). To study a species from one place in another, particularly between continents, teams in science can do the work more efficiently and more effectively. Team science is thus a logical solution to this issue (Goring et al. 2014). As you know from your science work, collaboration is not always easy though particularly when the work is being evaluated - whether in a class for groupwork or by a university of its researchers or by funding agencies in contrasting the merit of a researcher. Working with others to tackle global grand challenges is critical, but we also need to adapt how we value work in teams in science. Reflection questions What is biogeography? Are invasive species always ‘bad’ or problematic? How we up-value scientists that are more inclusive and collaborative? Formative checklist or steps Read the paper.

We compete with plants and other animals for space. Land literally provides the space for most components of human society through provision of direct and indirect ecosystem services. In the challenge reading, a synthesis of the restoration research for drylands in California was summarized (Christopher J. Lortie et al. 2018). The technique or replicable solution used was a formal systematic review, but there are many such synthesis tools (C. J. Lortie 2014). Synthesis tools provide the big picture to frame questions and evaluate the relevant merit or at least frequency that scientists use one technique versus another.

"],["testprep.html", "Chapter 6 Test prep", " Chapter 6 Test prep Learning outcomes Be able to select your own solution to an environmental challenge. Appreciate that there are many dimensions to every challenge. Write a clear, short description linking a replicable tool to a challenge studied in the scientific literature. Context Use the ‘ten simple rules to facilitate evidence implementation’ (Christopher J. Lortie and Owen 2020) and ‘ten simple rules for more objective decision-making’ (Fletcher, Wagner, and Bourne 2020) to structure notes and test prep. Steps for test prep Read the challenge paper provided in the test chapter herein. Make a list of all the solutions that they used or could have considered. Select one solution (a novel one not discussed yet), find 1-2 papers about that solution and 1-2 similar papers to the challenge, see test questions. Re-read the ten simple rules that underpins this course and read the ten simple rules for making better decisions too. Go to next chapter in this resource for the test. General workflow for take-home tests Traditional formative assessments such as in-class tests or exams are well understood. The rules of the game and extent of practice and experience with them vary from person-to-person, but most schools still adopt fixed-duration testing with limited to no access to outside materials. Open-book tests are common as well and typically include some access to resources such as notes or course materials but can also include open and online resources. The take-home test is a powerful and positive summative assessment instrument. However, effective study and prep can not always be clearly described for the learner. Strengths can include full and open access to materials online, experts, collaborative input, and adequate time to do deep work and think with reflection on insightful answers. Nonetheless, a limitation can be divergent expectations between student or learner and the graders. A take-home test is a bit of a chimera because it includes components of routine work, thinking, and depth associated with essays and papers but is nonetheless at times designed more as test with specific questions, Hence, a short primer on some ideas to consider from a workflow perspective are provided herein. Read the test in advance and give yourself time to ruminate, reflect, and ideate. Review test questions and ensure that you read all questions to the end before starting work. If there are readings, compile and collate them in advance so you have everything you need in one place. Review the rubric. Reverse-engineer this rubric to populate a list of terms, ideas, or visual-text hooks (keywords or concepts) that a grader will likely seek in refereeing your work. Open book = open information. Take advantage of related ideas, papers, reviews, and commit the appropriate and most parsimonious amount of time to secure supporting resources. Set a time limit for specific tasks and block your time into meaningful chunks with clear intermediate-level goals. For instance, get papers in one block, review rubric in another, etc. Write, take a break, and check rubric. Check your writing for clarity. If there are synthesis, design, or principle responses, step back, and consider high-level critical thinking elements or rules associated with good research planning. Consider triage answers that do not match your cognitive style, expertise, or are dissatisfied with the response. Use point value and relative weighting to decide if there better ways to allocate your time or select between questions to submit if provided.

Use no more than on page per answer with at least an 11point font, 1inch margins, and single-spacing. Test questions 1. Describe the environmental management challenge case associated with this topic and publication. In the summary, please ensure that you cover the following: link the basic science to the management (i.e. explain what the authors tested &amp; measured and then how this can relate to management), highlight the extent (i.e. explain if it is a global, regional, or local issue and why), and propose the implication of ignoring this issue.

Describe why this is not an environmental management challenge – i.e. play the ‘devil’s advocate’ because we know this happens all the time or more fairly every environmental issue is a balance between direct and indirect benefits from a natural system. Do not use fallacious arguments or ad hominem to do this. Use the following lines of argument: list 2 critical limitations of the study (or what viable improvements are needed), highlight the direct needs of people for the system/idea/issue and explain, explain a ‘hope for the best’ strategy that maximizes direct benefit to humans and propose an argument for the resilience/recovery/buffering of the system without a big change (i.e. business as usual model).

Turn your passion and interests into formal scientific evidence for social good. Synthesize peer-reviewed science papers. Context Time to choose your own adventure. Flex your creativity. Apply your critical thinking skills to an environmental challenge that is important - to you! Find your science-to-magic workflow and do a scientific synthesis. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e. SDGs) are a perfect place to begin. There are a total of 17 goals describing 169 targets as of 2021. Virtually every single goal is directly or indirectly tied to the environment. Some, are very direct such as clean water, life on land, life below water, climate action, zero hunger, and poverty. We need natural systems to sustain and support these goals. Natural systems now need us, and now you here, to summarize the scientific evidence for some focused element of a goal. This is a just a suggested focus - any environmental management challenge is fair game for synthesis and certainly will benefit from the process. Synthesis Scientific synthesis is big picture science that describe a set of studies on a pinpointed topic (C. J. Lortie 2014). There are at least three simple and direct options that are amenable to a capture of the research associated with the environmental challenge you identified. Narrative review as a highlight, short commentary, or new idea paper that is a snapshot of the key findings from a field research summarizing the main discoveries and/or listing the most critical research gaps. Papers like these are often called Insights, Forum, or Ignite. Systematic reviews are similar to narrative reviews, but clear criteria are listed explaining how you selected papers (i.e. these search terms used in the Web of Science, only studies that had these key inclusion attributes, etc.). Systematic are more replicable because others could follow your steps and get the same set of papers and hopefully reach similar conclusions about the corpus of evidence. These reviews also typically provide some simple quantitative data about the set of studies such as number of countries where the research was done, total sample sizes, number of variables examined, or any attributes that describe what the research was for a specific detail. The narrative component is similar to the first option because it can state what we know and what do not but these reviews do so much more precisely. Even a few numbers go a long way to convincing people about the extent that we know or have studied a subject in science. Papers like these are often termed Short Commentary or Mini-Review. Meta-analyses are systematic reviews plus for each primary study you summarize, you capture the relative efficacy of the treatment tested. Papers like this are often termed Reviews or Meta-analyses but other terms can be used too. Note: in some fields of research the terms ‘systematic review’ and ‘meta-analysis’ are used interchangeably, but in most environmental sciences, meta-analyses always have a measure of the strength of evidence from each studied included in the synthesis whilst systematic reviews typically do not. So for instance, narrative review might provide insights into vaccine research and reported that we have tested three vaccine types but need to test more alternatives. A systematic review would state this too but mention how they checked the science, i.e. we checked 100 papers using these terms x,y, &amp; z in Web of Science, and it might also state how many people were tested in total in all studies. This is thus a more powerful synthesis. However, the gold standard would be the meta-analysis that can summarize all of the above but also reports how well each vaccine type tested actually works on average across all the studies for each one. Summary of options synthesis elements benefits limitations narrative review summary, insights, next steps more opinion, can be shorter, less detailed processing the research literature can be less compelling without some specific evidence listed and is difficult to repeat systematic review summary, insights, next steps, explanation of how studies were selected in the review, can have counts of ideas tested more specific, can be repeated, and can be more compelling need to keep track of how you selected papers, need to sort through papers in more detail in addition to capturing main ideas meta-analyses all of above possible but must also include an assessment of the strength of evidence of each study included in the synthesis gold standard, reader can get a sense of how effective a treatment or intervention is relative to another need to extract means or measures of efficacy with sample sizes or variance from each study Steps Review the 17 SDGs. Familiarize yourself again with the scientific synthesis options that can describe and capture the state-of-the-art research for any environmental challenge. Select a topic that you care about. Check Google Scholar and/or The Web of Science trying different terms. If too many studies still, filter than to most cited or the last three years of research only. Get those papers. Do a quick read of at least the abstracts. Take a break. Reflect on the environmental challenge you want to tackle and ensure the terms you used and the papers you have are studying the dimension of the challenge you want to summarize. Go for it. Decide if it makes sense to do a short narrative, systematic, or meta. Compile whatever evidence you need from the studies to do a,b, or c (ie ideas and concepts, count up factors or replicates, or for a meta, do they all or most report similar data and list a mean and sample size you can use). Move onto next step - infographic or comic. Outcomes from this work A clear vision of the challenge you want to tackle. A set of ideas, papers, and the outcome you ultimately provide. The evidence you need to work some magic - ie to draw a comic/infographic and then write a very short paper using one of the three formats (narrative, systematic, or meta). "],["scicomm.html", "Chapter 9 Scientific communication", " Chapter 9 Scientific communication Learning outcomes Practice your communication skills. Be creative. Simplify complex scientific evidence appropriately. Context Scientific communication is now its own field of research and activity. It is critical that biology for environmental management promotes better communication. Without effective delivery of evidence, decisions that need science will struggle. Here, we use ten simple rules for scientific comics (McDermott, Partridge, and Bromberg 2018) to inform our sharing the scientific synthesis work began in the previous chapter. Simplication of science and aggregation of complex evidence is not a trivial skill. It is a challenge to respectfully communicate science but ensure it is accessible to a wide audience. Comics are perfect. Infographics are also powerful, and they are typically more complex information but compile findings still very visually. A comic tells a story and shares the science whilst infographics are also visual but connect ideas in a mini-poster format to the share evidence. Here are examples of the very best from the journal Nature. Instructions This is a stepping stone assignment or scaffolding to recognize the work you have already done in preparation for your short synthesis paper. It also provides an opportunity be more visual, tell a story, be funny, or present the key evidence you found in an infographic. If you elect to do a comic, you can draw by hand then scan it or sketch using a digital tool. If infographic, try using a free online tool, Keynote on a Mac, or PowerPoint to draw a single-slide and put your key evidence there. Use your evidence from your synthesis. Pick a few key points.

Practice critical thinkings in evidence reuse in the sciences. Be able to read evaluate published meta-analyses. Context As described in the ‘scientific synthesis’ section in this course, there are at least three contemporary tools available to a synthesis scientist in the environmental sciences. Narrative reviews are most effective when they briefly highlight key findings for a small field of research or identify critical gaps. Systematic reviews are more significant contribution to knowledge engineering because they provide the blueprint for replication, i.e. they describe how they selected the studies they summarized, and also because they provide more specific evidence. Finally, meta-analyses are the gold standard. For the purposes of this course of study, biology for environmental management, any of these three options are within reach. Nonetheless, metas can be demanding in time, and if you elect to tackle your environmental challenge with this tool, I recommend a very limited and restrictive set of studies. This can be done using very precise terms in The Web of Science or Google Scholar and/or limiting returns of papers to only the top 10-15 most cited or more recent 2-5 years. The capacity to critically examine a published meta is an invaluable asset to becoming a more literate citizen. The paper ‘How to critically read ecological meta-analyses’(Shrier 2015) is a resource developed for that purpose. Here is another ‘how-to-read’ published metas, and finally, if this is the synthesis tool for you, here is recent practical guide how to do meta-analysis (in eight steps). Steps for this component Read the suggested how-to paper. Compare and contrast the evidence you compiled for your synthesis and used for the comic or infographic and that you will use again for the final synthesis paper with the ‘how to critically evaluate meta’ ideas proposed. Decide what is most appropriate based on the evidence and reporting provided in those peer-reviewed studies. Skip ahead to the ‘paper writing’ section of this course and the ‘paper’ section too for rubric and instructions to facilaite the best decision for what category of paper you select to write. All the very, very short, but each differs slightly in they handle and present evidence. "],["writing.html", "Chapter 11 Paper writing", " Chapter 11 Paper writing Learning outcomes Critically weigh evidence to decide how to best report it. Write a short synthesis paper. Consolidate and hone your writing to be logical and structured even when short. Context Writing is an art. Telling a story well, even in science, is a fundamental professional life skill. Being brief is a virtue. Integrating evidence into scientific writing without being overwhelming is ideal. Here, you can tackle this by reusing your environmental evidence for the challenge you selected. This is an excellent, brief set of guidelines to consider, in general, to consider for better, more clearly structured writing (Mensh and Kording 2017). Yes, there is always room for improvement. Specific this course, you must choose narrative, systematic, or meta. This might have been decided right-up-front because of the nature of the challenge and the evidence that was reported in the papers you compiled. For instance, there was limited data you could extract from the papers, each paper tackled the same challenge but did so very differently, or it was not tractable to process the evidence more formally either then identifying what we know, do not, or where to go. Steps for writing Find your style. Organize your thoughts. Decide if you need a single, simple graphic to support your paper. Write your draft, rapidly, now. Correct later. Let is sit for while. Aim for &lt;2500 words. See final instructions and rubric in next section. Tips &amp; tricks for synthesis papers Scope terms and ideas using Google Scholar. Search The Web of Science with those key terms. Consider putting the main concept as first term, and refine to ‘title’ only search to limit returns and provide a very focused set of papers. Check for meta-analyses, reviews, and systematic reviews on your topic to get up to speed rapidly and ensure your work is novel and/or advancing knowledge. You can do this using the ‘refine’ function following your search in The Web of Science or you can add meta-analy* etc as a separate row directly in the first step of searching this resource. Knowledge advances can be made through what we know and what do not know. Summary of breadth and depth including gaps is a critical synthesis outcome. State the science, but focus on synthesis science for this short paper. Synthesis science is putting together sets of studies to take the big picture view of knowledge. It is not single-point thinking but distributional. See sample sentences. Primary studies and science will typically state ‘we found that…’, ‘this study showed that…’, ‘there is an effect of x on y in this system…’ etc. Point thinking is powerful, but if there are more than a few related studies, we can move to much broader (although perhaps less specific) conclusions and dramatically extend the scope of inference. Synthesis science papers will be more likely to include statements like the following: ‘these studies found that..’, ‘often, many (or even state x how many) studies found…’, ‘the most frequently used method to test for effects on x on y were…’, ‘in this field of study, it was uncommon to… (state gap)’, or ‘there is an opportunity in this field to…’. Basically, use language that conveys the perspective you took across a set of studies, i.e the distribution and breadth of knowledge for a set of related concepts in science. Consider using a simple table to track and summarize what each study tested, why, how, and what they reported. Using a table to organize a set of papers for any review facilitates cross-study contrasts. State your purpose for the synthesis and revisit over and over again as you read primary studies. The purpose can also be framed as a single question in the domain of ‘what do we know about…’, or ‘how do we study…’, ‘why do why study…’, or in this specific course offering, ‘how extensively is the environmental challenge studied’, or ‘what are most common solutions reported in the scientific literature to address a specific challenge’. A crystal clear goal for your synthesis will ensure you do not get lost in the details of the science.

Hone your critical thinking. Develop a new set of tools for processing readings. CREATE philosophy Science is creative. Reading scientific literature can also be a creative process. Active reading includes highlights, annotation, and note taking. These approaches to reading and study can increase retention, comprehension, and engagement with scientific ideas. However, the teaching philosophy and pedagogy of CREATE is novel and relevant and takes this one step further. CREATE pedagogy stands for Consider, Read, Elucidate the hypothesis or purpose, Analyze and interpret data or evidence, and Think of the next Experiment. This reading process is creative, active, and phenomenal practice for all professional work. If the process seems useful to you, please give it a try for this course. This work is optional, but it is literally only 5-10 minutes extra per week. Here are some proposed exercises for you to consider to test out the CREATE approach. If there is time in lectures, we will do them together. Use paper, Powerpoint, or any sketching digital tool you prefer to write or draw. If you elect to try them out and want to submit them as well, optional, there are spots provided in turnitin.com. CREATE applications example CREATE application instructions 1 new title &amp; abstract write a catchy, compelling alternative title to the reading and a very short 250 word abstract in your own words 2 concept map draw a Venn diagram, flowchart, or any type of visual that summarizes how the big ideas from the reading connect to one another 3 cartoon summary draw a fun cartoon summarizing the reading, infographics are also powerful heuristics and synthesis summary tools of salient points 4 novel questions a good reading or paper should generate as many new questions as the ones it answers, list a few for the reading 5 made-up data &amp; predictive plotting sketch a plot of data or relationship you would like to see supporting the main idea or hypothesis proposed in paper 6 experimental cartoon sketch the experiment, schematic of methods described in paper 7 visual worflow propose a next experiment to a paper as a simple workflow with logical steps connecting one another 8 pros-cons table make a short table summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of a paper 9 figure-legend improv provide a figure legend for a data visualization from a paper, redacted or provided 10 best-sentence competition from a paper, select a single sentence that resonated with reader or was novel and profound as a next step for the discipline 11 shark tank run a debate or shark tank of a published paper, use a weighted Likert Scale list of evidence from a paper 12 KISS principle keep it simple scientists, propose a simple, one-factor, multi-level follow-up experiment to confirm or replicate a key finding from a paper "],["life.html", "Chapter 14 Life", " Chapter 14 Life Action Make it count! Help those around you use scientific evidence to inform their decisions. Science can support better decisions in health, the environment, social policy, and all domains of the human endeavour. We need to make better decisions, and we can do it. Use your creative spirit and now finely-honed critical thinking. Be on the lookout for solutions. Frame problems in life, big or small, as challenges. Seek solutions in the obvious and in the novel. Less is more. Often the simplest fix is the best.
