#### Learning outcomes {-}  
1. Be able to select your own solution to an environmental challenge.
2. Appreciate that there are many dimensions to every challenge.  
3. Write a clear, short description linking a replicable tool to a challenge studied in the scientific literature.

#### Context {-}  
Lakes and other bodies of water are our natural canary-in-the-coalmine tools to examine many components of global change. Here, the test paper is provided in advance [@RN6387]. 

Use the 'ten simple rules to facilitate evidence implementation...' [@RN6861] and 'ten simple rules for more objective decision-making' [@RN7223] to structure notes and test prep.

#### Steps for test prep {-}  
1. Read the challenge paper.  
2. Make a list of all the solutions that they used.
3. Select one solution, find a paper about that solution, see test question.  
4. Re-read the [ten simple rules](https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2020-0021) that underpins this course and read the [ten simple rules for making better decisions](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007706) too. 
5. Go to next chapter in this resource for the test.
