Here is an overview of the content and topics covered in this course of study. Complete are your own pace, asynchronously. However, please check the official course outline if you are doing the work for credit to ensure you submit summative work at the appropriate times.  

### Instructions {-} 

Read and and use the papers to link environmental challenges that we collectively face with potential solutions. Only one solution per challenge is suggested here, but there are many dimensions to each challenge and numerous solutions too.  

The link to decks are optional. They are my interpretation of the papers from a science-to-magic philosophy and identify the salient elements and concepts from each reading that resonated with my perspective as an ecologist.  

### Schedule {-} 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
schedule <- read_csv("./schedule.csv")
knitr::kable(schedule, booktabs = TRUE)

```
