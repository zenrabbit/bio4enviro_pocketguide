### Instructions {-}  
1. Read [this paper](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0520#.W6Uwoy-ZMWo) [@RN6387].
2. Answer the following questions. 
3. Use **no more than on page per answer** with at least an 11point font, 1inch margins, and single-spacing.  

### Test questions {-}
**1.** Describe the environmental management challenge case associated with this topic and publication.  In the summary, please ensure that you cover the following:  

(a) link the basic science to the management (i.e. explain what the authors tested & measured and then how this can relate to management),  
(b) highlight the extent (i.e. explain if it is a global, regional, or local issue and why), and  
(c) propose the implication of ignoring this issue.  

total = **10** points.

**2.** Describe why this is not an environmental management challenge – i.e. play the ‘devil’s advocate’ because we know this happens all the time or more fairly every environmental issue is a balance between direct and indirect benefits from a natural system.  Do not use fallacious arguments or *ad hominem* to do this.  Use the following lines of argument:  

(a) list 2 critical limitations of the study (or what viable improvements are needed),  
(b) highlight the direct needs of people for the system/idea/issue and explain,  
(c) explain a ‘hope for the best’ strategy that maximizes direct benefit to humans and propose an argument for the resilience/recovery/buffering of the system without a big change (i.e. business as usual model).  

total = **10** points.  

**3.** Reverse engineer a general, replicable solution to this challenge.  

(a) list solutions beginning with the most evident in descending relevance order,  
(b) propose and explain the replicable solution that is most relevant based on research,  
(c) cite the research you did to design your replicable solution by providing the citation to two solution papers and include just a single sentence for each explaining why you selected that paper as evidence.  

total = **20** points. 

### Format for answers {-}  
1. Write in full sentences, no more than 1 page per answer.
2. Total of 3 pages :).  
3. Include your name, surname, and student ID at the top of each page.
4. Work in your preferred text editor, but you must submit responses as a single file in PDF format only to [turnitin.com](https://www.turnitin.com). Class ID and key provided in the official course outline.  

### Rubric {-}  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
test <- read_csv("./key_test.csv")
knitr::kable(test, booktabs = TRUE)

```
