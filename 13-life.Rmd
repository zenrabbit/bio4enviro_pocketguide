### Action {-}  
Make it count! Help those around you use scientific evidence to inform their decisions. Science can support better decisions in health, the environment, social policy, and all domains of the human endeavour. We need to make better decisions, and we can do it. Use your creative spirit and now finely-honed critical thinking. Be on the lookout for solutions. Frame problems in life, big or small, as challenges. Seek solutions in the obvious and in the novel. Less is more. Often the simplest fix is the best. Good luck, and I hope you enjoyed these materials and this course as much I did.
